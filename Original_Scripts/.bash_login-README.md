README for: .bash_login

This file was the product of three different additions. The first addition was the welcome 
to the user with their name and date. This addition was the first or second chapter of the 
Linux class at my college; and mainly focused on the basic utilities (i.e. date, cal, ls, 
etc.). 

The second addition was the change to the PS1 (prompt) variable. This addition was not 
part of an assignment, rather something I did of my own merit. We only went over the 
fact that the shell variables can be temporarily changed (unless exported or put into a 
file that changes it on login, such as the .bash_login file).

The third addition was the product of ch. 4, and was mainly focused on chaining utilities 
together and getting information from the system (i.e. disk usage, memory usage, running 
processes, etc.). This was in the part of the class when I had not yet learned the more 
advanced scripting techniques, and there is a bunch of redundant echo statements, and 
the script does not take advantage of command substitution $(). However, the updated 
script will express each snippet in one line with command substitution and newlines in
the echo statements.
