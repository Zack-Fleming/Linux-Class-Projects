README for /Updated_Scrpts/.bash_aliases:

This file is a set of all of the aliases that I currently
use on my linux-based systems. The aliases are organized 
by categories, depending on the use or goal of the command(s).
This organization, however, in only in the alias file; when 
the aliases are listed by the 'alias' command, the aliases are 
still listed alphabetically. Below is a list of the categories 
used when organizing my aliases (again, only in the alias 
definition file).

Organization Categories:
 1. system - modifies the entire system; usually ones that need sudo access
 2. ease-of-use - makes repetative tasks easier
